# Math-Scores

This is example which using statistics knowledge and python apply for proving my assumptions

I use 'exams.csv' as datas for this workshop

My data contains 6 columns below:

1."gender" - male / female

2."race/ethnicity" - one of 5 combinations of race/ethnicity

3."parent education level" - highest education level of either parent

4."lunch" - whether the student receives free/reduced or standard lunch

5."test prep course" - whether the student took the test preparation course

6."math" - exam score in math

what i want to know :

1.Does location of each group come from different distribution? If each group come from different distribution , How is different?

2.Which factor(among "gender","race/ethnicity","parent education level","lunch","test prep course") have the greatest impact on math scores?
